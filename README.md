# Manual

## Introduction
This numerical calculation is based on [MNPBEM MATLAB toolbox](http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/). First time users are expected to read the manuals of MNPBEM for debugging and explanation of BEM commands. Surface plasmons are coherently oscillating eletrons in metal nanoparticles. Through coupling to plasmon resonance modes of nanoparticles, the fluorescence process of a single-molecule fluorohore is strongly modified. The current scripts calculate the modified excitation and emission rates as a function of position around a nanoparticle with a given size, shape and material, and also the photodynamics of the modified molecule based on a three-state model.
