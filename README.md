## Introduction
This numerical calculation is based on [MNPBEM MATLAB toolbox](http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/). 
Surface plasmons are coherently oscillating eletrons in metal nanoparticles. Through coupling to plasmon resonance modes of nanoparticles, the fluorescence process of a single-molecule fluorohore is strongly modified. The codes calculate the modified excitation and emission rates as a function of position around a nanoparticle with a given size, shape and material.
