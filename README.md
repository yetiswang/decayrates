# Plasmon-enhanced fluorescence 

## Introduction

Surface plasmons are coherently oscillating eletrons in metal nanoparticles. Through coupling to plasmon resonance modes of nanoparticles, the fluorescence process of a single-molecule fluorohore is strongly modified. The codes calculate the modified excitation and emission rates as a function of position around a nanoparticle with a given size, shape and material.
